how to start:
1. git clone the ssh link from git hub
2. cd 'main directory name eg: 42kl-enen'
3. cd 1st sub-directory name

Create a new directory: mkdir

In Visual Studio code: 
    1. remember to save after all the command
    2. back to TERMINAL and write: gcc -o *new file name* x y
        x = file name
        y = file name
    3. then write: ./*new file name*

Cat = see what is inside the file only (not for directory)
cd = back to main origin directory
cd ..= back to previous one
pwd = where am i

1. git add "X" "Y" [when I am in the sub-directory] [proper way: git add file1.txt folder/file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt]
2. git commit -m "leave a comment"
3. git push
